# Skills Builder - Claude Best Practices Integration Complete

## What Was Done

The Skills Builder has been updated to fully incorporate [Anthropic's official Claude Skills best practices](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices).

## Key Changes

### 1. **Best Practices Documentation**
- ✅ Created `CLAUDE_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Complete reference of Anthropic's guidelines
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with Claude-specific features and requirements

### 2. **Schema Updates** (`code/schema.py`)
- ✅ Enforces official limits: 64-char names, 1024-char descriptions
- ✅ Added `validate_best_practices()` function with checks for:
  - Gerund form naming ("Processing PDFs" vs "Process PDFs")
  - Description format (active voice, includes WHAT + WHEN)
  - Windows-style paths (enforces forward slashes)
  - Time-sensitive information detection
  - MCP tool format validation (`ServerName:tool_name`)
  - Feedback loop suggestions
- ✅ Added optional fields: `reference_files`, `validation`, `mcp_tools`

### 3. **Validation Enhancement** (`code/validate.py`)
- ✅ Structural validation (blocking errors)
- ✅ Best practices validation (warnings/suggestions)
- ✅ Clear output: errors vs suggestions
- ✅ SKILL.md length check (warns at >500 lines)

### 4. **Template Updates** (`templates/skill_md.tmpl`)
- ✅ YAML frontmatter with name + description (Claude requirement)
- ✅ Validation & Feedback Loop section
- ✅ MCP Tools section
- ✅ Reference Materials section
- ✅ Helper Scripts with execution modes
- ✅ Enhanced Safety & Confidentiality section

### 5. **New Example**
- ✅ `examples/best-practices/skill.spec.json` - Complete example following all guidelines
- Includes: reference files, validation feedback loop, proper naming, full description

## What The Builder Now Checks

### Blocking Errors (Must Fix)
- ❌ Missing required fields
- ❌ Name > 64 characters
- ❌ Description > 1024 characters
- ❌ Less than 2 triggers
- ❌ Windows-style backslashes in paths
- ❌ Invalid MCP tool format

### Best Practice Suggestions (Optional)
- ⚠️ Name not in gerund form
- ⚠️ Description missing WHAT or WHEN
- ⚠️ Description uses first/second person
- ⚠️ Time-sensitive information detected
- ⚠️ SKILL.md exceeds 500 lines
- ⚠️ Missing feedback loop for validation-heavy tasks

## Claude Best Practices Incorporated

### Core Principles
1. **Concise is key** - Token budget awareness, <500 line SKILL.md
2. **Degrees of freedom** - Support for high/medium/low freedom approaches
3. **Test with all models** - Guidance for Haiku/Sonnet/Opus

### Progressive Disclosure
- Reference files support (one level deep)
- Conditional content patterns
- Table of contents for long files

### Workflows & Feedback Loops
- Built-in validation loop support
- Checklist patterns
- Plan-validate-execute workflows

### Content Guidelines
- Time-sensitive content detection
- Consistent terminology enforcement
- Template patterns
- Examples patterns

### Code Execution
- Script execution modes (execute vs reference)
- Helper utilities structure
- Validation scripts
- MCP tool integration
