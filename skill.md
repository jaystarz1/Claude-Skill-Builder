# Building Claude Skills

A comprehensive skill-builder that creates production-ready Claude Skills following all official Anthropic guidelines.

## When to Use
- User wants to create a new Claude Skill
- User says "build a skill", "create a skill", "make a skill"
- User wants to validate or improve an existing skill
- User needs to package a skill for upload
- User asks about Skills best practices or architecture

## Inputs
- User's description of what the skill should do
- Workflow/procedures the skill should follow
- **CRITICAL: Examples of good outputs or use cases** (ALWAYS ASK FOR THESE)
- Optional: existing skill.spec.json file
- Optional: reference materials to include
- Optional: scripts or code to bundle

## Ground Rules
- Follow ALL Anthropic specifications (64-char names, 1024-char descriptions)
- **CRITICAL**: Skill names in SKILL.md YAML must be lowercase-with-hyphens-only (e.g., 'processing-pdfs', 'analyzing-data')
- **CRITICAL**: Skill names CANNOT contain reserved words: 'claude', 'anthropic', 'ai'
- **CRITICAL**: ALL filenames must be lowercase (SKILL.md, README.md are exceptions)
- **CRITICAL**: ALL folder names must be lowercase (e.g., 'examples/', 'references/', 'code/')
- **CRITICAL**: Example filenames must be lowercase with hyphens (e.g., 'example-1-posting-grievance.md')
- Use gerund form for spec names in examples ("Processing PDFs" becomes 'processing-pdfs' in SKILL.md)
- Descriptions must include WHAT it does AND WHEN to use it
- Always use forward slashes in paths (never backslashes)
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines (use progressive disclosure for more)
- No network access in scripts (Skills run in sandboxed environment)
- Only use pre-installed packages (no runtime installation)
- Validate against security best practices
- Generate skills that work on web, desktop, API, AND Claude Code

## Knowledge Base

This skill has access to comprehensive knowledge about Claude Skills:

### Core References
- **MASTER_KNOWLEDGE.md** - 15,000+ word complete reference covering:
  - What Skills are and how they work
  - Three-level loading architecture (metadata, instructions, resources)
  - Progressive disclosure patterns
  - Platform-specific deployment (claude.ai, API, Claude Code)
  - Security and trust model
  - Development best practices
  - API integration
  - Advanced patterns

- **CLAUDE_BEST_PRACTICES.md** - Anthropic's official guidelines including:
  - Naming conventions
  - Content quality standards
  - Progressive disclosure patterns
  - Workflow and feedback loop patterns
  - Testing requirements

### Technical Implementation
- **Schema validation** (`code/schema.py`) - Comprehensive validation rules
- **Templates** (`templates/`) - Production-ready skill templates
- **Examples** (`examples/`) - Reference implementations

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Discovery & Specification
1. Ask user what the skill should do (be specific)
2. Identify the workflow/procedure the skill follows
3. Determine inputs the skill needs
4. Establish guardrails and constraints
5. Define expected output format
6. **CRITICAL: Ask about examples** - Does the user have example outputs, documents, or use cases?
7. Identify any reference materials or scripts needed

**Key Questions:**
- What specific task does this skill perform?
- When should Claude use this skill? (triggers)
- What inputs does it need? (files, parameters, context)
- What rules must it follow? (guardrails)
- What's the step-by-step procedure?
- What should the output look like?
- **Do you have examples of good outputs/documents this skill should produce?** (ALWAYS ASK)
- **Do you have sample inputs or use cases to include as examples?** (ALWAYS ASK)
- Does it need reference files? (progressive disclosure)
- Does it need executable scripts? (code helper)
- Does it need validation? (feedback loops)

### Phase 2: Specification Creation
1. Create skill.spec.json following schema
2. Apply naming conventions (gerund form)
3. Craft description (WHAT + WHEN, active voice)
4. Define all required sections
5. Add optional features (reference files, code, validation)
6. Reference MASTER_KNOWLEDGE.md for patterns

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Name ≤ 64 characters?
- **Name is lowercase-with-hyphens-only?** (e.g., 'processing-pdfs')
- **Name does NOT contain 'claude', 'anthropic', or 'ai'?**
- Spec uses gerund form in examples? ("Processing PDFs")
- Description ≤ 1024 characters, includes WHAT + WHEN?
- At least 2 triggers defined?
- All required fields present?
- File paths use forward slashes?
- No time-sensitive content?
- MCP tools properly formatted (ServerName:tool_name)?

### Phase 3: Structure & Organization
1. **Create base directory structure** for the skill
2. **If user provided examples: CREATE examples/ folder** and save each example as a separate file
3. Determine if progressive disclosure needed (>500 lines?)
4. Organize reference files by domain/purpose
5. Plan code execution strategy (scripts vs generation)
6. Design validation/feedback loops if needed
7. Reference MASTER_KNOWLEDGE.md - Progressive Disclosure section

**CRITICAL: Examples Folder**
- **ALWAYS create examples/ folder if user provided ANY examples**
- Save each example with descriptive filename (example-1-posting-grievance.md)
- **ALL example filenames MUST be lowercase with hyphens** (no capitals, no underscores, no spaces)
- Include README.md in examples/ explaining what each example demonstrates
- Reference examples from SKILL.md so Claude knows they exist

**CRITICAL: Folder and Filename Rules**
- Folder names: lowercase only (examples/, references/, code/)
- File names: lowercase-with-hyphens.md (except SKILL.md and README.md)
- NO capital letters in filenames (SYNOPSIS.md ❌, synopsis.md ✅)
- NO underscores (example_1.md ❌, example-1.md ✅)
- NO spaces (example 1.md ❌, example-1.md ✅)

**Organization Patterns:**
- **Simple skills**: Just SKILL.md
- **Medium skills**: SKILL.md + reference files
- **Complex skills**: SKILL.md + reference/ + code/ + examples/
- **Multi-domain**: Separate reference files per domain

### Phase 4: Validation
1. Run structural validation (blocking errors)
2. Run best practices validation (warnings)
3. Check against CLAUDE_BEST_PRACTICES.md
4. Verify platform compatibility
5. Security audit (no network, proper error handling)

**Validation Categories:**
- ❌ **Errors** (must fix): Missing fields, limit violations, invalid formats
- ⚠️ **Warnings** (should fix): Best practice violations, suboptimal patterns

### Phase 5: Generation & Packaging
1. **Create the skill directory structure**
2. **If examples were provided: Save them to examples/ folder NOW**
3. Use `python -m code.cli new` to generate skill (if using CLI tool)
4. Verify all files created correctly
5. Check SKILL.md length (<500 lines recommended)
6. Validate generated content
7. **Verify examples/ folder exists and contains all provided examples**
8. **AUTOMATICALLY CREATE ZIP FILE** - Package the skill immediately after generation

**ZIP File Creation:**
After creating all skill files, automatically create a ZIP file using the filesystem:write_file tool with this Python script pattern:
```python
import zipfile
from pathlib import Path

skill_dir = Path('[skill-directory-path]')
zip_name = '[skill-name].zip'

with zipfile.ZipFile(str(skill_dir / zip_name), 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf:
    for file_path in skill_dir.rglob('*'):
        if file_path.is_file() and '.git' not in str(file_path) and not str(file_path).endswith('.zip'):
            arcname = file_path.relative_to(skill_dir)
            zipf.write(file_path, arcname)
```

**Generated Structure:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (with YAML frontmatter)
├── skill-name.zip ⭐ (AUTOMATICALLY CREATED)
├── examples/ (CRITICAL: if user provided examples)
│   ├── README.md (explains what each example shows)
│   ├── example-1-[descriptive-name].md
│   ├── example-2-[descriptive-name].md
│   └── example-N-[descriptive-name].md
├── templates/ (if output contract includes templates)
├── reference/ (if progressive disclosure used)
├── code/ (if code helper enabled)
└── README.md
```

### Phase 6: Packaging & Deployment
1. Use `python -m code.cli pack` to create ZIP
2. Provide upload instructions per platform:
   - **claude.ai**: Settings → Capabilities → Upload skill
   - **API**: POST to /v1/skills endpoint
   - **Claude Code**: Install to ~/.claude/skills/ or .claude/skills/

**Platform-Specific Notes:**
- claude.ai: Individual user, requires Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise
- API: Organization-wide, requires beta headers
- Claude Code: Filesystem-based, plugin or manual install

### Phase 7: Testing & Iteration
1. Test with example triggers
2. Try on Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus (if possible)
3. Observe Claude's usage patterns
4. Iterate based on feedback
5. Reference MASTER_KNOWLEDGE.md - Development Best Practices

- "Help me build a skill for my [workflow]"
- "Validate my skill spec"
- "Package my skill for upload"
- "How should I structure a skill for [use case]?"

## Safety & Confidentiality
- Redact PII from generated files unless required for skill function
- Audit any executable scripts for security issues
- Warn about time-sensitive content that will become outdated
- Flag potential network access (not allowed in Skills)
- Ensure scripts have explicit error handling (don't punt to Claude)

## Reference Materials

When building skills, always consult:
- `MASTER_KNOWLEDGE.md` - Complete technical reference
- `CLAUDE_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Official guidelines
- `examples/best-practices/` - Production-ready example

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Task Skill
Just SKILL.md with clear procedure. Good for straightforward tasks.

### Pattern 2: Progressive Disclosure Skill
SKILL.md + reference files. For skills with optional complexity.

### Pattern 3: Code Execution Skill
SKILL.md + scripts in code/. For deterministic operations.

### Pattern 4: Validation Feedback Loop Skill
Plan → Validate → Execute → Verify. For error-prone complex tasks.

### Pattern 5: Multi-Domain Skill
SKILL.md + domain-specific reference files. Prevents loading irrelevant context.

### Pattern 6: MCP Integration Skill
Teaches Claude how to use MCP tools effectively.
