# Building Claude Skills

A comprehensive skill-builder that creates production-ready Claude Skills following all official Anthropic guidelines.

## When to Use
- User wants to create a new Claude Skill
- User says "build a skill", "create a skill", "make a skill"
- **User wants to update, modify, or fix an existing skill**
- User wants to validate or improve an existing skill
- User needs to package a skill for upload
- User asks about Skills best practices or architecture

## Inputs
- User's description of what the skill should do
- Workflow/procedures the skill should follow
- **CRITICAL: Examples of good outputs or use cases** (ALWAYS ASK FOR THESE)
- Optional: existing skill.spec.json file
- Optional: reference materials to include
- Optional: scripts or code to bundle

## Ground Rules
- Follow ALL Anthropic specifications (64-char names, 1024-char descriptions)
- **CRITICAL**: Skill names in SKILL.md YAML must be lowercase-with-hyphens-only (e.g., 'processing-pdfs', 'analyzing-data')
- **CRITICAL**: Skill names CANNOT contain reserved words: 'claude', 'anthropic', 'ai'
- **CRITICAL**: ALL filenames must be lowercase (SKILL.md, README.md are exceptions)
- **CRITICAL**: ALL folder names must be lowercase (e.g., 'examples/', 'references/', 'code/')
- **CRITICAL**: Example filenames must be lowercase with hyphens (e.g., 'example-1-posting-grievance.md')
- Use gerund form for spec names in examples ("Processing PDFs" becomes 'processing-pdfs' in SKILL.md)
- Descriptions must include WHAT it does AND WHEN to use it
- Always use forward slashes in paths (never backslashes)
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines (use progressive disclosure for more)
- No network access in scripts (Skills run in sandboxed environment)
- Only use pre-installed packages (no runtime installation)
- Validate against security best practices
- Generate skills that work on web, desktop, API, AND Claude Code

## Knowledge Base

This skill has access to comprehensive knowledge about Claude Skills:

### Core References
- **MASTER_KNOWLEDGE.md** - 15,000+ word complete reference covering:
  - What Skills are and how they work
  - Three-level loading architecture (metadata, instructions, resources)
  - Progressive disclosure patterns
  - Platform-specific deployment (claude.ai, API, Claude Code)
  - Security and trust model
  - Development best practices
  - API integration
  - Advanced patterns

- **CLAUDE_BEST_PRACTICES.md** - Anthropic's official guidelines including:
  - Naming conventions
  - Content quality standards
  - Progressive disclosure patterns
  - Workflow and feedback loop patterns
  - Testing requirements

### Technical Implementation
- **Schema validation** (`code/schema.py`) - Comprehensive validation rules
- **Templates** (`templates/`) - Production-ready skill templates
- **Examples** (`examples/`) - Reference implementations

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Discovery & Specification
1. Ask user what the skill should do (be specific)
2. Identify the workflow/procedure the skill follows
3. Determine inputs the skill needs
4. Establish guardrails and constraints
5. Define expected output format
6. **CRITICAL: Ask about examples** - Does the user have example outputs, documents, or use cases?
7. Identify any reference materials or scripts needed

**Key Questions:**
- What specific task does this skill perform?
- When should Claude use this skill? (triggers)
- What inputs does it need? (files, parameters, context)
- What rules must it follow? (guardrails)
- What's the step-by-step procedure?
- What should the output look like?
- **Do you have examples of good outputs/documents this skill should produce?** (ALWAYS ASK)
- **Do you have sample inputs or use cases to include as examples?** (ALWAYS ASK)
- Does it need reference files? (progressive disclosure)
- Does it need executable scripts? (code helper)
- Does it need validation? (feedback loops)

### Phase 2: Specification Creation
1. Create skill.spec.json following schema
2. Apply naming conventions (gerund form)
3. Craft description (WHAT + WHEN, active voice)
4. Define all required sections
5. Add optional features (reference files, code, validation)
6. Reference MASTER_KNOWLEDGE.md for patterns

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Name ‚â§ 64 characters?
- **Name is lowercase-with-hyphens-only?** (e.g., 'processing-pdfs')
- **Name does NOT contain 'claude', 'anthropic', or 'ai'?**
- Spec uses gerund form in examples? ("Processing PDFs")
- Description ‚â§ 1024 characters, includes WHAT + WHEN?
- At least 2 triggers defined?
- All required fields present?
- File paths use forward slashes?
- No time-sensitive content?
- MCP tools properly formatted (ServerName:tool_name)?

### Phase 3: Structure & Organization
1. **Create base directory structure** for the skill
2. **If user provided examples: CREATE examples/ folder** and save each example as a separate file
3. Determine if progressive disclosure needed (>500 lines?)
4. Organize reference files by domain/purpose
5. Plan code execution strategy (scripts vs generation)
6. Design validation/feedback loops if needed
7. Reference MASTER_KNOWLEDGE.md - Progressive Disclosure section

**CRITICAL: Examples Folder**
- **ALWAYS create examples/ folder if user provided ANY examples**
- Save each example with descriptive filename (example-1-posting-grievance.md)
- **ALL example filenames MUST be lowercase with hyphens** (no capitals, no underscores, no spaces)
- Include README.md in examples/ explaining what each example demonstrates
- Reference examples from SKILL.md so Claude knows they exist

**CRITICAL: Folder and Filename Rules**
- Folder names: lowercase only (examples/, references/, code/)
- File names: lowercase-with-hyphens.md (except SKILL.md and README.md)
- NO capital letters in filenames (SYNOPSIS.md ‚ùå, synopsis.md ‚úÖ)
- NO underscores (example_1.md ‚ùå, example-1.md ‚úÖ)
- NO spaces (example 1.md ‚ùå, example-1.md ‚úÖ)

**Organization Patterns:**
- **Simple skills**: Just SKILL.md
- **Medium skills**: SKILL.md + reference files
- **Complex skills**: SKILL.md + reference/ + code/ + examples/
- **Multi-domain**: Separate reference files per domain

### Phase 4: Validation
1. Run structural validation (blocking errors)
2. Run best practices validation (warnings)
3. Check against CLAUDE_BEST_PRACTICES.md
4. Verify platform compatibility
5. Security audit (no network, proper error handling)

**Validation Categories:**
- ‚ùå **Errors** (must fix): Missing fields, limit violations, invalid formats
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings** (should fix): Best practice violations, suboptimal patterns

### Phase 5: Generation & Packaging
1. **Create the skill directory structure**
2. **If examples were provided: Save them to examples/ folder NOW**
3. **Create UPDATING.md file** - Critical reminder about ZIP recreation
4. Use `python -m code.cli new` to generate skill (if using CLI tool)
5. Verify all files created correctly
6. Check SKILL.md length (<500 lines recommended)
7. Validate generated content
8. **Verify examples/ folder exists and contains all provided examples**
9. **AUTOMATICALLY CREATE ZIP FILE** - Package the skill immediately after generation

**ZIP File Creation:**
After creating all skill files, automatically create a ZIP file using the filesystem:write_file tool with this Python script pattern:
```python
import zipfile
from pathlib import Path

skill_dir = Path('[skill-directory-path]')
zip_name = '[skill-name].zip'

with zipfile.ZipFile(str(skill_dir / zip_name), 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf:
    for file_path in skill_dir.rglob('*'):
        if file_path.is_file() and '.git' not in str(file_path) and not str(file_path).endswith('.zip'):
            arcname = file_path.relative_to(skill_dir)
            zipf.write(file_path, arcname)
```

**Generated Structure:**
```
skill-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md (with YAML frontmatter)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skill-name.zip ‚≠ê (AUTOMATICALLY CREATED)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UPDATING.md ‚≠ê (CRITICAL REMINDER)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/ (CRITICAL: if user provided examples)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (explains what each example shows)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example-1-[descriptive-name].md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example-2-[descriptive-name].md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example-N-[descriptive-name].md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/ (if output contract includes templates)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reference/ (if progressive disclosure used)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code/ (if code helper enabled)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

**UPDATING.md File:**
Every skill MUST include an UPDATING.md file with this content:
```markdown
# üî¥ UPDATING THIS SKILL

## CRITICAL: Changes Require New ZIP Upload

If you modify ANY file in this skill, you MUST:

1. **Recreate the ZIP file**
2. **Upload the new ZIP to claude.ai**

### Why?
The skill files on disk ‚â† the skill Claude is using.
Claude loads skills from uploaded ZIP files, not from your filesystem.

### When to Create New ZIP?
- ‚úÖ Changed SKILL.md (even typos)
- ‚úÖ Modified examples/
- ‚úÖ Updated references/
- ‚úÖ Fixed code/
- ‚úÖ ANY file change at all

### How to Recreate ZIP

#### Option 1: Ask Claude (Easiest)
```
"Create a new ZIP for this skill"
```

#### Option 2: Python Script (Manual)
```bash
python3 << 'EOF'
import zipfile
from pathlib import Path

skill_dir = Path('.')
zip_name = '[skill-name].zip'

with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_name, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf:
    for file_path in skill_dir.rglob('*'):
        if file_path.is_file() and '.git' not in str(file_path) and not str(file_path).endswith('.zip'):
            arcname = file_path.relative_to(skill_dir)
            zipf.write(file_path, arcname)

print(f'Created: {zip_name}')
EOF
```

### How to Upload

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Capabilities in claude.ai
2. Remove old version of this skill
3. Click "Upload skill"
4. Select the NEW ZIP file
5. Test your changes

**Changes take effect immediately after upload.**
```

### Phase 6: Packaging & Deployment
1. Use `python -m code.cli pack` to create ZIP
2. Provide upload instructions per platform:
   - **claude.ai**: Settings ‚Üí Capabilities ‚Üí Upload skill
   - **API**: POST to /v1/skills endpoint
   - **Claude Code**: Install to ~/.claude/skills/ or .claude/skills/

**Platform-Specific Notes:**
- claude.ai: Individual user, requires Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise
- API: Organization-wide, requires beta headers
- Claude Code: Filesystem-based, plugin or manual install

### Phase 7: Testing & Iteration
1. Test with example triggers
2. Try on Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus (if possible)
3. Observe Claude's usage patterns
4. Iterate based on feedback
5. Reference MASTER_KNOWLEDGE.md - Development Best Practices

## Updating Existing Skills

When the user wants to modify, fix, or improve an existing skill:

### Update Procedure
1. **Identify what needs to change** - Ask user for specific changes needed
2. **Locate the skill directory** - Find the skill folder on filesystem
3. **Make the requested changes** - Edit SKILL.md, examples, references as needed
4. **AUTOMATICALLY RECREATE ZIP FILE** - Always create fresh ZIP after any changes
5. **Remind user to upload new ZIP** - Changes won't take effect until uploaded

### Changes That Require ZIP Recreation
- ‚úÖ **ANY change to SKILL.md** - Procedure updates, wording fixes, new sections
- ‚úÖ **ANY change to examples/** - New examples, editing existing examples
- ‚úÖ **ANY change to references/** - Updated guides, new reference files
- ‚úÖ **ANY change to code/** - Script fixes, new helper scripts
- ‚úÖ **Even tiny typo fixes** - ALL changes need new ZIP

- [ ] Validation feedback loops
- [ ] MCP tool integration
- [ ] Visual analysis

## Example Triggers
- "Build a skill for [specific task]"
- "Create a custom skill that [does something]"
- "Help me build a skill for my [workflow]"
- **"Update the [skill-name] skill to add/fix [something]"**
- **"Fix a typo in the synopsis skill"**
- **"Add a new example to the [skill-name] skill"**
- "Validate my skill spec"
- "Package my skill for upload"

## Safety & Confidentiality
- Redact PII from generated files unless required for skill function
- Audit any executable scripts for security issues
- Warn about time-sensitive content that will become outdated
- Flag potential network access (not allowed in Skills)
- Ensure scripts have explicit error handling (don't punt to Claude)

## Reference Materials

When building skills, always consult:
- `MASTER_KNOWLEDGE.md` - Complete technical reference
- `CLAUDE_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Official guidelines
- `examples/best-practices/` - Production-ready example

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Task Skill
Just SKILL.md with clear procedure. Good for straightforward tasks.

### Pattern 2: Progressive Disclosure Skill
SKILL.md + reference files. For skills with optional complexity.

### Pattern 3: Code Execution Skill
SKILL.md + scripts in code/. For deterministic operations.

### Pattern 4: Validation Feedback Loop Skill
Plan ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Verify. For error-prone complex tasks.

### Pattern 5: Multi-Domain Skill
SKILL.md + domain-specific reference files. Prevents loading irrelevant context.

### Pattern 6: MCP Integration Skill
Teaches Claude how to use MCP tools effectively.
